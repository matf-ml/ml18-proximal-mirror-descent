# ml18-proximal-mirror-descent
Luka Samardzija

Project is part of the Machine Learning course at Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade.

Mirror descent algorithm is implemented for linear SVC. The results are then compared with the built-in SVC.
In the second part of the project, mirror descent algorithm is used in weight regularization of neural network.
